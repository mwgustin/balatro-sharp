After the twitter drama about the Balatro code / calculation logic, I wanted to take a stab at how I'd approach it from a C#/OO approach.

This is not intended to be a full implementation or cover all scenarios, just a thought experiment.  It's also not meant to be a slight against the Balatro devs.  Their code works, is maintainable for them, works within the constraints of their language and frameworks, and made an incredible game (not to mention tons of money). #1 priority is shipping, everything else is secondary.  

Essentially, I got [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/)
